    }
}

```

### Prometheus:**

1. You can access Prometheus in a web browser using your server's IP and port 9090:

   `http://<your-server-ip>:9090`

   **Installing Node Exporter:**

   You can access Node Exporter metrics in Prometheus.

2. **Configure Prometheus Plugin Integration:**

   Integrate Jenkins with Prometheus to monitor the CI/CD pipeline.

   **Prometheus Configuration:**

   To configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from Node Exporter and Jenkins, you need to modify the `prometheus.yml` file. Here is an example `prometheus.yml` configuration for your setup:

   ```yaml
   global:
     scrape_interval: 15s

   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'node_exporter'
       static_configs:
         - targets: ['localhost:9100']

     - job_name: 'jenkins'
       metrics_path: '/prometheus'
       static_configs:
         - targets: ['<your-jenkins-ip>:<your-jenkins-port>']
   ```

   Make sure to replace `<your-jenkins-ip>` and `<your-jenkins-port>` with the appropriate values for your Jenkins setup.

   Check the validity of the configuration file:

   ```bash
   promtool check config /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
   ```

   Reload the Prometheus configuration without restarting:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/-/reload
   ```

   You can access Prometheus targets at:

   `http://<your-prometheus-ip>:9090/targets`


####Grafana

**Step 6: Check Grafana Status:**

Verify the status of the Grafana service to ensure it's running correctly:

```bash
sudo systemctl status grafana-server
```

**Step 7: Access Grafana Web Interface:**

Open a web browser and navigate to Grafana using your server's IP address. The default port for Grafana is 3000. For example:

`http://<your-server-ip>:3000`

You'll be prompted to log in to Grafana. The default username is "admin," and the default password is also "admin."

**Step 8: Change the Default Password:**

When you log in for the first time, Grafana will prompt you to change the default password for security reasons. Follow the prompts to set a new password.

**Step 9: Add Prometheus Data Source:**

To visualize metrics, you need to add a data source. Follow these steps:

- Click on the gear icon (⚙️) in the left sidebar to open the "Configuration" menu.

- Select "Data Sources."

- Click on the "Add data source" button.

- Choose "Prometheus" as the data source type.

- In the "HTTP" section:
  - Set the "URL" to `http://localhost:9090` (assuming Prometheus is running on the same server).
  - Click the "Save & Test" button to ensure the data source is working.

**Step 10: Import a Dashboard:**

To make it easier to view metrics, you can import a pre-configured dashboard. Follow these steps:

- Click on the "+" (plus) icon in the left sidebar to open the "Create" menu.

- Select "Dashboard."

- Click on the "Import" dashboard option.

- Enter the dashboard code you want to import (e.g., code 1860).

- Click the "Load" button.

- Select the data source you added (Prometheus) from the dropdown.

- Click on the "Import" button.

You should now have a Grafana dashboard set up to visualize metrics from Prometheus.

Grafana is a powerful tool for creating visualizations and dashboards, and you can further customize it to suit your specific monitoring needs.

That's it! You've successfully installed and set up Grafana to work with Prometheus for monitoring and visualization.

2. **Configure Prometheus Plugin Integration:**
    - Integrate Jenkins with Prometheus to monitor the CI/CD pipeline.


**Phase 5: Notification**

1. **Implement Notification Services:**
    - Set up email notifications in Jenkins or other notification mechanisms.

# Phase 6: Kubernetes

## Create Kubernetes Cluster with Nodegroups

In this phase, you'll set up a Kubernetes cluster with node groups. This will provide a scalable environment to deploy and manage your applications.

## Monitor Kubernetes with Prometheus

Prometheus is a powerful monitoring and alerting toolkit, and you'll use it to monitor your Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, you'll install the node exporter using Helm to collect metrics from your cluster nodes.

### Install Node Exporter using Helm

To begin monitoring your Kubernetes cluster, you'll install the Prometheus Node Exporter. This component allows you to collect system-level metrics from your cluster nodes. Here are the steps to install the Node Exporter using Helm:

1. Add the Prometheus Community Helm repository:

    ```bash
    helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
    ```

2. Create a Kubernetes namespace for the Node Exporter:

    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace prometheus-node-exporter
    ```

3. Install the Node Exporter using Helm:

    ```bash
    helm install prometheus-node-exporter prometheus-community/prometheus-node-exporter --namespace prometheus-node-exporter
    ```

Add a Job to Scrape Metrics on nodeip:9001/metrics in prometheus.yml:

Update your Prometheus configuration (prometheus.yml) to add a new job for scraping metrics from nodeip:9001/metrics. You can do this by adding the following configuration to your prometheus.yml file:


```
  - job_name: 'Netflix'
    metrics_path: '/metrics'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['node1Ip:9100']
```

Replace 'your-job-name' with a descriptive name for your job. The static_configs section specifies the targets to scrape metrics from, and in this case, it's set to nodeip:9001.

Don't forget to reload or restart Prometheus to apply these changes to your configuration.

To deploy an application with ArgoCD, you can follow these steps, which I'll outline in Markdown format:

### Deploy Application with ArgoCD

1. **Install ArgoCD:**

   You can install ArgoCD on your Kubernetes cluster by following the instructions provided in the [EKS Workshop](https://archive.eksworkshop.com/intermediate/290_argocd/install/) documentation.

2. **Set Your GitHub Repository as a Source:**

   After installing ArgoCD, you need to set up your GitHub repository as a source for your application deployment. This typically involves configuring the connection to your repository and defining the source for your ArgoCD application. The specific steps will depend on your setup and requirements.

3. **Create an ArgoCD Application:**
   - `name`: Set the name for your application.
   - `destination`: Define the destination where your application should be deployed.
   - `project`: Specify the project the application belongs to.
   - `source`: Set the source of your application, including the GitHub repository URL, revision, and the path to the application within the repository.
   - `syncPolicy`: Configure the sync policy, including automatic syncing, pruning, and self-healing.

4. **Access your Application**
   - To Access the app make sure port 30007 is open in your security group and then open a new tab paste your NodeIP:30007, your app should be running.

**Phase 7: Cleanup**

1. **Cleanup AWS EC2 Instances:**
    - Terminate AWS EC2 instances that are no longer needed.
